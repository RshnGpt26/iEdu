                    We counsel parents from humble backgrounds to send their children to school and assist them through the
                    admission process. In schools, we make learning fun. We train teachers to impart learning using
                    child-friendly and interactive teaching-learning methods. We set libraries and infrastructure right,
                    conduct computer and English classes, promote and facilitate extra-curricular activities and sports.
